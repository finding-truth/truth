        <h2>The Truth</h2>
        <hr>
        <h4>An Introduction</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>When speaking about a subject so debated and argued, in a time where it seems as if the answers are so unclear, I offer a humble perspective.</p>
        <p>
            We live in a time that is completely immersed in temptation.<br>
            The tempation to lie for profit, to turn away from rightousness for personal pleasure, to accept wrong doctrine for convenience.<br>
            We are surrounded by a doctrine of weakness, that of the weak man. It is the doctrine of corruption that leads many astray from the right path.<br><br>
            I can offer a perspective as a person that has grown up in this generation.
            I have a bachelors in physics and was an atheist for as long as I can remember. 
            My belief in the <i>deception</i> of the idea of God was very rigid and well formulated. 
            I spent much of my time, when not studying, debating believers as to why their faith is unjustified and baseless.
            Most people defend their beliefs with a <i>mere</i> feeling. No grounding, no evidence, no answers to my numerous questions.<br><br>
            Just pure feeling.<br><br>
            My goal was to <i>show</i> them that we do not need such archaic doctrine anymore, 
            and that the only people that <i>need</i> a God are weak minded and easily controllable. 
            In a word, I was trying to convince people to abandon their faith and join the rest of humanity in the new age.<br><br>
            I had reason and logic on my side. <br>
            I had the truth, the logic, the facts, and all I wanted to do was to help people see it.<br>
            I asked more questions than anything, because I believed that once people saw for themselves that theyhad no answers, 
            they would think deeper about those questions, and eventually, start to see the light.<br><br>
            There is no God, there is no reason for you to subjugate yourselves to this doctrine that you do not understand.<br><br>
            It was written by men to control men.<br><br>
            And all I needed was for people to try to answer my questions. If you tell someone how something is, there is no reason to think, 
            but if you ask someone how something is, they will tell you what they know to be true. <br><br>
            Then you ask a question that's contrary to their explanation. <br>
            Then wait for a response. <br>
            Then repeat. <br><br>
            Do this until there are no more answers to your questions, instead what you will receive subsquently is anger, 
            which is when I knew I had done the right thing.<br> 
            I had planted the seed of the truth.<br><br>
            I tell you this because it gives you an idea of how often I engaged with believers in convincing them that they are wrong.
            It is important to know this because you will understand just how important it was for me to do what I believed was right.
            I want to give you the context of who I was, what I did, and why I did it.<br>
            I tell you this so that you can <i>clearly</i> understand that I was a true atheist and secular thinker. 
            I was armed with the knowledge of the truth, the truth that I had received from greater thinkers than myself.<br><br>
            I knew I was right.<br>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>The Actual Truth</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
            As you may have guessed, I am not writing this because I now want to convince you of the truth of atheism.
            No, quite the contrary.<br><br>
            I am writing this now as a believer, convicted in my heart of the truth of Jesus.<br><br>
            There is no way that I can share my mind with anyone to show what I have seen and experienced,
            but what I have seen and experienced was powerful enough to take a staunch atheist like myself,
            and turn me into what I am today. <br><br>
            Today I write to you as a humbled man. I tell you honestly, I do not know anything.<br>
            What I do know, is greatly shadowed by what I do not know.
            The only things I know are granted to me.<br><br>
            This is the key to unlocking the truth of God.<br><br>
            You must know that you do not know, no matter how evident something seems.<br><br>
            The word for this is <strong>Humility.</strong><br><br>
            Anyone that is seeking the <i>actual</i> truth must first humble himself in accepting that they do not know everything.<br><br>
            <strong>Your answers will not be found in this world.</strong><br><br>
            In the bible, God tells man how to find Him.<br><br>
            "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you..." Matthew 7:7<br><br>
            This is how, in my very confused state, I came to <i>know</i> God.<br>
            The truth of the bible; the truth of the words of Jesus.<br>
            I sought to earnestly know what could have caused billions of people, over the span of 2000 years, 
            to read the bible and to live by the words found in it. <br><br>
            What could drive a man to live with such restriction and devotion for something he can not even see?<br><br>
            My devotion to knowing the truth has lead me here; 
            writing this for anyone that is earnestly and honestly seeking to know.<br><br>
            We live in a time very far from the truth, and the repercussions of this are widespread.<br>
            The destruction of good has lead to the erection of what is evil in its place.<br>
            You will have everything you could ever possibly want in this world, but you will be dead inside.<br><br>
            Once this happens, you will seek the truth, and it will set you free.<br><br>
           <h2> This is how you will know that it is the truth.</h2><br><br>
           There are many things one can learn, but it all first starts with a foundation.<br>
           You must first be willing to humble yourself, and accept that you may not know everything that there is to know.<br><br>
           Then I will pose this question to you:<br><br>
           Do you truly want to learn about God? 
           <h1>Ask Him.</h1>
        </p>
        <hr>
            <h4>A Final Note</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Once a person reachs the truth, and is aware of the things that surround him, he will ultimately come to understand
            that there is a war taking place every single day.<br>
            It is a war for your mind. The thoughts that you think and the way that you behave.<br><br>
            You are <strong>that</strong> important in the grand scheme of things.<br><br>
            Be contastly aware and always seek to find the truth.<br><br>
            He provides the way out of darkness. <br><br>
            He is more real than you or I.
